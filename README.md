# Store-Performance-Optimization-Using-Data-Analytics

## Project Objective: 
- To utilize the machine learning and data analysis technique to optimize store performance, forecast demand, and enhance customer experience through segmentation and personalized marketing strategies.

## Key Highlights

- Combined and cleaned multiple datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- Visualized sales trends and seasonal patterns across stores and departments.
- Used SARIMAX to model and forecast sales with external influencing factors.
- Applied clustering techniques to segment customers by shopping patterns.
- Tested business hypotheses and provided actionable insights for retail strategy.


## Intrepretation and Results

### Hypothesis 1: Anomaly Detection in Sales Data
- Conclusion: Isolation Forest for anomaly detection on the Weekly_Sales data. Several data points were identified as anomalies based on their isolation scores.
- Interpretation: These anomalies represent unusual weekly sales figures that deviate significantly from the typical patterns. 
- Result: The Isolation Forest model successfully flagged data points with significantly different sales patterns as anomalies.


### Hypothesis 2: Time Series Anomaly Detection in Sales Data
- Conclusion: Prophet was used to model the time series of Weekly_Sales, and anomalies were identified by comparing actual values to the forecast and its uncertainty intervals.
- Interpretation: Anomalies detected weeks where the actual sales significantly differed from what the Prophet model predicted based on historical trends and seasonality. These could indicate unexpected spikes or drops in sales over time.
- Result: The Prophet model highlighted time points where the observed sales fell outside the expected range, suggesting temporal anomalies.


### Hypothesis 3: Customer Segmentation
- Conclusion: KMeans clustering was applied to segment stores based on features like size and weekly sales. The analysis suggested an optimal number of clusters.
- Interpretation: The resulting clusters likely represent different types of stores based on their scale and sales volume. This segmentation can be used for targeted strategies.
- Result: Stores were grouped into distinct clusters based on their size and weekly sales, allowing for potential differentiation in business strategies.


### Hypothesis 4: Demand Forecasting
- Conclusion: Prophet was used to forecast future Weekly_Sales. The model captured the trend and yearly seasonality in the data.
- Interpretation: The forecast provides an estimate of expected weekly sales in the future, along with a measure of uncertainty. This is crucial for planning inventory and resources.
- Result: A time series forecast for Weekly_Sales was generated, showing an overall trend and seasonal patterns that can be used for future planning.


### Hypothesis 5: Impact of External Factors on Sales
- Conclusion: Prophet with regressors was explored to understand the impact of external factors (like CPI, Unemployment, IsHoliday, and markdown variables) on Weekly_Sales.
- Interpretation: The coefficients of the regressors in the Prophet model would indicate the direction and magnitude of the impact of these external factors on sales.
- Result: The framework for assessing the impact of external factors on sales using Prophet regressors and its shows the model's component plots and regressor coefficients.


### Hypothesis 6: Personalization Strategies
- Conclusion: The customer segmentation analysis (Hypothesis 3) lays the for personalization strategies by identifying different groups of stores.
- Interpretation: Understanding the characteristics of each store segment allows for tailoring approaches in areas like promotions, inventory, and resource allocation.
- Result: The store segmentation provides a basis for developing personalized strategies for different groups of stores.


### Hypothesis 7: Strategy and Real-World Application
- Conclusion: There are various analytical techniques applied to retail sales data, from anomaly detection to forecasting and segmentation.
- Interpretation: These analyses can inform business decisions such as identifying unusual events, predicting future demand, and understanding different store performance profiles.
- Result: Through this analysis on retail sales data we can drive more strategic decision-making.


## Conclusion
- The analysis provides valuable insights into the store's weekly sales data. 
- It identifies anomalies, forecasts future sales, and segments stores based on their characteristics.
- The use of Prophet and Isolation Forest demonstrates effective techniques for time series analysis and outlier detection, while KMeans offers a way to understand the heterogeneity among stores.
- Incorporating external factors into the forecasting model using Prophet regressors sets the stage for a more comprehensive understanding of sales drivers.


## Interpretation:
- The findings suggest that weekly sales are influenced by temporal patterns and can be subject to unusual events.
- Stores also exhibit different characteristics in terms of size and sales volume.
- By leveraging these insights, the retail business can potentially optimize its operations, marketing efforts, and resource allocation.
